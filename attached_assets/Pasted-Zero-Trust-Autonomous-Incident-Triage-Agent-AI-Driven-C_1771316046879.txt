Zero-Trust Autonomous Incident Triage Agent
AI-Driven Classification, Escalation, and MIM Orchestration

Overview
The Autonomous Triage Agent is an event-driven, zero-trust AI system that automatically classifies operational alerts across enterprise platforms and determines whether to:
Create a ServiceNow incident


Trigger PagerDuty escalation


Initiate a Major Incident (MIM) process


Route to human review when confidence is low


The system uses structured AI reasoning (Amazon Bedrock) combined with deterministic policy enforcement, secure identity via Okta, and full audit logging.

Problem It Solves
Enterprise environments generate high-volume alerts from:
Salesforce


SnapLogic


AWS workloads


Adobe Experience Manager


Splunk


CloudWatch
New Relic


Manual triage creates:
Slow response times


Inconsistent classification


MIM overuse or underuse


Limited auditability of decisions


This system provides consistent, explainable, policy-governed AI triage.

Core Capabilities
1. Event Correlation
Ingests alerts from multiple sources and normalizes them into a unified triage schema.
2. Context Enrichment
Pulls:
Relevant log slices from Splunk


CloudWatch Logs Insights results


Recent similar incidents from ServiceNow


3. AI Classification (Structured Output Only)
Bedrock model produces:
Classification (noise, low, medium, high, sev1)


Confidence score


Recommended escalation actions


Suggested assignment group


Structured ServiceNow fields


4. Deterministic Escalation Engine
Applies policy thresholds such as:
Confidence requirements


Production-only auto-MIM gating


Two-signal confirmation requirement


Duplicate suppression window


5. Zero Trust Authentication
The agent authenticates using:
Okta OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials


Short-lived JWT tokens


Scope-restricted API access


Gateway-level validation


All actions are attributable to the Triage Agent service identity.
6. Full Audit Trail
Each triage run logs:
Trigger source


Agent identity


Evidence pointers


AI output (hash + summary)


Final decision


SNOW / PD / MIM IDs


Correlation ID


Audit records are written to Splunk and CloudWatch.

Confidence threshold gating


Two-signal requirement for MIM


Human override branch


Rate limiting & circuit breakers


Fail-closed behavior if identity validation fails



Maturity Model
The system should have toggles to allow us to implement a maturity model
Level 0 – Manual triage
 Level 1 – Alert-driven ticket creation
 Level 2 – AI-assisted classification
 Level 3 – Autonomous, policy-governed AI orchestration (target state)

Strategic Value
Reduces Mean Time To Triage (MTTT)


Improves escalation consistency


Minimizes unnecessary MIM events


Strengthens zero-trust compliance posture


Provides explainable AI decision audit trail


Scales across multi-platform enterprise environments
